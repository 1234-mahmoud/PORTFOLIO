            I am a Front-End Developer specializing in web interface development
            using React.js, with a strong passion for creating smooth and
            interactive user experiences. I graduated from Damietta University -
            Faculty of Computers and Information with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in
            Computer Science. I have skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            React.js, along with experience using Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, and
            other modern technologies. I am always eager to enhance my skills
            and stay updated with the latest trends in front-end development,
            focusing on performance, user experience optimization, and designing
            responsive interfaces that adapt to different devices.
